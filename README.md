A support library providing a [Swagger Core](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core) model converter for the
[Omittable](https://github.com/Osmerion/Omittable) library to support deriving OpenAPI specifications from omittable
types.


## Usage

```java
ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
objectMapper.registerModule(new OmittableModule());

ModelConverters converters = new ModelConverters();
converters.addConverter(new OmittableModelConverter(objectMapper));

converters.read(MyModel.class);
```


## Building from source

### Setup

This project uses [Gradle's toolchain support](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html)
to detect and select the JDKs required to run the build. Please refer to the
build scripts to find out which toolchains are requested.

An installed JDK 17 (or later) is required to use Gradle.

### Building

Once the setup is complete, invoke the respective Gradle tasks using the
following command on Unix/macOS:

    ./gradlew <tasks>

or the following command on Windows:

    gradlew <tasks>

Important Gradle tasks to remember are:
- `clean`                   - clean build results
- `build`                   - assemble and test the project
- `publishToMavenLocal`     - build and install all public artifacts to the
                              local maven repository

Additionally `tasks` may be used to print a list of all available tasks.
